# checklist_champ

A productivity management application where users can fill either a calendar or a checklist with goals,
chores or projects, and set rewards that they can unlock for themselves based on the tasks they complete.
Optionally the user can enable a second person to manage these rewards giving the feeling of being compensated by
someone else for their achievements.
